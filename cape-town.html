      <h3>Visit Cape Town</h3>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </section>

  <br>
  <p class="intro">Cape Town is the best place in Africa and the World to visit according to
    The New York Times and The Daily Telegraph in 2014 Cape Town is the second
    most populous city in South Africa after Johannesburg and also the legislative capital of South Africa.
  </p>

<section>
  <div id="about">

    <h5>About Cape Town</h5>

    <p class="description">Cape Town is the legislative capital city of South Africa. Cape Town is on South Africa's
      southwestern coast close to the Cape of Good Hope, and is the southernmost city on the African continent. It is
      the gateway to the globally renowned Cape Winelands which includes the towns of Franschhoek, Stellenbosch and
      Paarl.
    </p>
    <p class="description">Cape Town is nicknamed the Mother City within South Africa. Compared to the more business
      oriented Johannesburg it is known for its relaxed and leisurely atmosphere. Some jokingly claim that the reason it
      is called the Mother City is that it takes at least 9 months to get anything done in Cape Town! Compared to other
      parts of South Africa Cape Town is also distinctly more "western", and South Africans from other provinces
      sometimes jokingly say they are traveling to Europe when visiting Cape Town.
    </p>

  </div>

  <div id="about">

    <h5>Geography</h5>
    <p class="description">Cape Town is located at latitude 33.55° S (approx. the same as Sydney and Buenos Aires and
      equivalent to Casablanca and Los Angeles in the northern hemisphere) and longitude 18.25° E. Table Mountain, with
      its near vertical cliffs and flat-topped summit over 1,000 m (3,300 ft) high, and with Devil's Peak and Lion's
      Head on either side, together form a dramatic mountainous backdrop enclosing the central area of Cape Town, the
      so-called City Bowl. The metropolis of Cape Town is spread over a wide area, from Somerset West and Durbanville in
      the east to Atlantis in the north and Cape Point in the south. The city centre is situated in a fairly small area
      between Table Bay and Table Mountain
    </p>

  </div>  

  <div id="about">

    <h5>Climate</h5>
    <p class="description">Cape Town has a warm Mediterranean climate (Köppen "Csb"), with mild, moderately wet winters
      and dry, warm summers. Winter, which lasts from the beginning of June to the end of August, may see large cold
      fronts entering for limited periods from the Atlantic Ocean with significant precipitation and strong
      north-westerly winds. Winter months in the city average a maximum of 18 °C (64 °F) and minimum of 8.5 °C (47 °F)
      Total annual rainfall in the city averages 515 millimetres (20.3 in) although in the southern suburbs, close to
      the mountains, rainfall is significantly higher and averages closer to 1000 millimetres (40 in). Summer, which
      lasts from December to March, is warm and dry with an average maximum of 26 °C (79 °F) and minimum of 16 °C (61
      °F). The region can get uncomfortably hot when the Berg Wind, meaning "mountain wind", blows from the Karoo
      interior for a couple of weeks in February or March. Spring and summer generally feature a strong wind from the
      south-east, known locally as the south-easter or the Cape Doctor, so called because it blows air pollution away.
      This wind is caused by a high-pressure system which sits in the South Atlantic to the west of Cape Town, known as
      the South Atlantic High. Cape Town receives 3,100 hours of sunshine per year</p>

  </div>

  <div id="about">

    <h5>History</h5>
    <p class="description">Before the European colonial era what is now the Western Cape was inhabited by Khoikhoi and
      San groups, whom the Dutch called "Hottentots", "Strandlopers" and "Bushmen" (terms that are now considered racist
      and offensive). From the late 15th century, European ships (primarily Portuguese) started to visit the area,
      firstly for fresh food and water, then later for whaling and trading with the locals. Cape Town's colonial history
      started in 1652, when founder Jan van Riebeeck established a trading post there for the Dutch East Indies Company
      (VOC), as a stopping point on the Cape Route. Even though South Africa is the part of Africa located furthest from
      Europe, it was the first, and up until the 19th century only place which was substantially colonized by Europeans.
      The reason is that the Cape, while being furthest from Europe, also is relatively far from the equator.

  <div id="about">

    <h5>Getting in</h5>
    <p class="description">
    <ol>
      <li>By Plane; Cape Town International Airport > This is South Africa's second biggest airport (O.R. Tambo
        International Airport in Johannesburg being the biggest) and the third busiest in Africa. About 20 km east of
        the city centre, it is easily accessible via all national roads and is situated directly at the N2 near
        Bellville.</li>
      <br>
      <li>By Train; All scheduled South African passenger trains are run by PRASA (the Passenger Rail Agency of South
        Africa), which has different divisions for long distance (intercity) trains and commuter (suburban) trains.
        Shosholoza Meyl operates intercity trains and MetroRail operates commuter trains in major cities. </li>
      <br>
      <li>By Car; Most roads in Cape Town and its surroundings are in excellent condition, which makes getting around in
        a car a straightforward task. However, there is a risk of getting carjacked when it is dark or while you stop at
        the traffic lights. It is not quite as dangerous as the media will make you believe, but you should take care.
        Ask the staff in your hotel or anyone who knows the city well about the safe and unsafe areas of Cape Town.</li>
      <br>
      <li>By Bus; Every major bus company has intercity connections from Cape Town, taking you to other areas in South
        Africa and to Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe. Every day up to six buses run to particular cities.</li>
      <br>
      <li>By Boat</li>

    </ol>

  <div id="about">

    <h5>Getting Around</h5>
    <p class="description">
    <ol>
      <li>By Foot; Cape Town is not the most pedestrian-friendly city in the world. There are areas that are ideal for
        walking, such as the St George's Mall and Greenmarket Square areas in the city centre, the V&A Waterfront or
        some beach areas. Care needs to be taken when walking in other parts of the city, as the roads can be busy, and
        having pedestrian right of way does not necessarily mean that vehicles will cede to you. Pedestrians normally
        cross when the road is clear, regardless of red pedestrian lights.</li>
      <br>
      <li>By Bicycle; It is possible to get around by bicycle. There are some bike lanes in the center. </li>
      <br>
      <li>By Car; Many car hire companies are based in the airport as well being found all over town. Note that South
        Africa is a left-hand traffic country. Visitors from countries where traffic moves on the right-hand side may
        need to take some time to get familiar with the different road rules. Getting a car with automatic transmission
        at some rental services is not always easy so try to reserve a car in advance if you prefer an automatic.</li>
      <br>
      <li>By Metered Taxi; Metered taxis are controlled by the city council and can be considered safe and reliable. The
        price per kilometer is around R8-R10 and can often be read at the taxis side door. You can also set a fixed
        price with the driver, especially when going to a far away destination such as the airport which is about 21 km
        from city center and the fare can be bargained down to R180.</li>
      <br>
      <li>By Ride Hailing Services; Ride hailing services are widely available across Cape Town, in particular Uber and
        Bolt.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>By Minibus Taxi; Minibus taxis are used widely by locals but tourists are usually discouraged from using them,
        except for the Green Point - Sea Point - Clifton - Camps Bay route that is frequently used by tourists. They
        cover most of the Cape Town Metropolitan Area and are very cheap, Some minibus taxi operators have noticed the
        upsurge in the tourist market and are starting to provide safe and legal alternatives to the traditional minibus
        taxis. They are more expensive than traditional minibus taxis, but still far cheaper than metered taxis.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>By Train; Cape Town has a commuter rail system called Metrorail, though it is the locals that primarily use
        it. They have put in a lot of work to improve comfort and safety on the trains though it doesn't match up with
        the best in the world. As such, it is advisable to go on first-class. Cape Town's main station is located in the
        city centre on the corner of Strand and Adderley Street. The suburban network of lines is fairly good with over
        120 stations. You can go on a picturesque ride to Simon's Town along the Cape Peninsula's east coast.

    <h5>Attractions (What to See)</h5>
    <p class="description">
    <p>Almost everything is possible in Cape Town, from a nice guided city tour through shark cage-diving. The easiest
      way to get an overview on things to do, nice restaurants, clubs, tours etc. is to walk into one of the visitors
      centres which are in several areas (V&A Waterfront, City Bowl, Green Point, etc.)
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>By Foot; Cape Town is not the most pedestrian-friendly city in the world. There are areas that are ideal for
        walking, such as the St George's Mall and Greenmarket Square areas in the city centre, the V&A Waterfront or
        some beach areas. Care needs to be taken when walking in other parts of the city, as the roads can be busy, and
        having pedestrian right of way does not necessarily mean that vehicles will cede to you. Pedestrians normally
        cross when the road is clear, regardless of red pedestrian lights.Cable Car to the top of Table Mountain; The
        cable car and the pathways on top of the mountain are wheelchair accessible. A separate lift entrance and
        friendly staff will help accessibility visitors. Weather conditions at the top of the mountain are not the same
        as at the bottom so always take something warm to wear when going up the mountain, even if it is a nice toasty
        30˚C at the bottom of the mountain. Wear sunblock and carry a water bottle (there is also a free drinking
        fountain at the top near the cable station). There is a cafe with a limited range of snacks, coffee, beer and
        wine at the top. Table Mountain is the home of a small animal, the rock rabbit (known locally as the 'Dassie')
        whose closest relative, DNA-wise, is the elephant, and you can see them running around on the rocks at the top
        of the mountain.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Climbing Table Mountain; Platteklip Gorge is the most accessible and therefore the most popular route for
        climbing up Table Mountain. You start from Tafelberg Road and proceed up a steep gully to the top of Table
        Mountain. It's a steep two hours but well worth the effort and you can jump in the cable car back down to spare
        your knees. The cable car does not operate in strong winds so you need to check before departing. Remember to
        take water, sunblock, a hat and jacket. Climbing the mountain in the heat is a grueling task.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Cape Peninsula; Go to the Cape of Good Hope via Simon's Town and the African penguin colony at Boulders. Visit
        Cape Point in the Table Mountain National Park, maybe have lunch there before taking a hike in a quieter part of
        the reserve to immerse yourself in the essence of the landscape.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Swimming; Beaches on the False Bay side of the peninsula are the most popular with swimmers as the water is
        warmer. St James has the most picturesque tidal pool on the stretch between Muizenberg and Kalk Bay, while
        Clovelly and Fish Hoek beaches wrap around a sheltered bay with soft, white sands. Fishing boats, hobie cats and
        kayaks launch from here too. Brave hearts can sun-worship and swim naked in the freezing water of the isolated
        and breathtaking nudist beach Sandy Bay near Llandudno.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Surfing; Cape Town is one of the best places to surf. Muizenberg is a good place for beginners to learn to
        surf, Gary offers reasonably priced lessons from a shop facing the beach.

      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Sunset cruise. On visiting Cape Town take the opportunity for a sunset cruise from one of the services lined
        up along the V&A dockside. Well worth seeing the sunset but also the view back towards the town and Table
        Mountain from the sea

      </li>
      <br>

      <li>Winelands. Tour the beautiful Constantia Valley wine estates Groot Constantia, Buitenverwagting, Klein
        Constantia and Constantia Uitsig before checking out the Cape Winelands around Stellenbosch, Paarl and
        Franschhoek. Stellenbosch has the added attraction of being an historical university town and Franschhoek, well
        established as the food capital of the Cape, is home to three of the country's top ten restaurants. The views
        are extraordinary.

      <h5>Where to Stay (Accommodation)</h5>
      <p class="description">Accommodation in Cape Town ranges from hostels (of which there are many) to luxury
        accommodation. Actually, there are so many hotels, B&Bs and guest houses that it can be difficult to decide
        where to stay! Staying in the city centre often works out cheaper as all the attractions are nearby, but stick
        to one of the neighbourhoods next to the central area for better prices and a quieter night's sleep. The area
        around vibey Kloof Street in Gardens/Tamboerskloof with its young cafe culture and hip shopping is a good
        choice. You could consider sleeping in one of the suburbs. It is normally quieter and there is less traffic than
        in Central Cape Town. The suburbs in the south, like Muizenberg, Fish Hoek or Simon's Town, or near the
        winelands (see Cape Winelands) are ones to try.
