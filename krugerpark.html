            <h5>Overview</h5>

            <p class="description">
                Kruger National Park is a South African National Park and one of the largest game reserves in Africa. It
                covers an area of 19,485 km2 (7,523 sq mi) in the provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga in northeastern
                South Africa, and extends 360 km (220 mi) from north to south and 65 km (40 mi) from east to west. The
                administrative headquarters are in Skukuza. Areas of the park were first protected by the government of
                the South African Republic in 1898, and it became South Africa's first national park in 1926.


                <br>
                <br>
                To the west and south of the Kruger National Park are the two South African provinces of Limpopo and
                Mpumalanga, respectively. To the north is Zimbabwe, and to the east is Mozambique. It is now part of the
                Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park, a peace park that links Kruger National Park with the Gonarezhou
                National Park in Zimbabwe, and with the Limpopo National Park in Mozambique.


                <br>
                <br>
                The park is part of the Kruger to Canyons Biosphere, an area designated by the United Nations
                Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as an International Man and Biosphere Reserve


            <h5>Climate</h5>
            <p>The climate of the Kruger National Park and Lowveld is subtropical. Summer days are humid and hot. The
                rainy season is from September until May. The Kruger National Park website lists September and October
                as the driest periods, culminating in rains late in October. Because the park is 360 km from North to
                South, climate can vary throughout the park. Skukuza in the southern part of the park is about 2-3
                degrees cooler throughout the year than Pafuri in the north, with significantly more precipitation.

            </p>

            <h5>How to get there </h5>
            <p class="description">
                Many visitors to Kruger are self-drive visitors. At the same time however many people (particularly
                internationals) chose to fly to the park’s periphery and then hire a vehicle.

                <br><br>
                <b>By Air:</b> There are daily flights to the Kruger Park operating from Johannesburg to the recently
                reopened Skukuza Airport, Phalaborwa Airport, Hoedspruit Airport and the Kruger/Mpumalanga International
                Airport (KMIA) located between Nelspruit and White River. Daily flights also operate to Skukuza from
                Cape Town. KMIA also receives daily flights from Durban and Cape Town, and there is also a flight from
                Cape Town to Hoedspruit.
                <br><br>
                <b>By Coach:</b> A number of coach tours are available of varying degrees of luxury. Transport
                companies, often in conjunction with tour operators/travel agents

                    The world-renowned Kruger National Park offers a wildlife experience that ranks with the best in
                    Africa. Kruger national park is home to an impressive number of species: 336 trees, 49 fish, 34
                    amphibians, 114 reptiles, 507 birds and 147 mammals. Man's interaction with the lowveld environment
                    over many centuries - from bushman rock paintings to majestic archaeological sites like Masorini and
                    Thulamela - is very evident in the Kruger National Park.
                    <br><br>
                    Sighting the "Big Five" has become something of a quest for many people when on safari, and the
                    Kruger National Park has more than its fair share of these, with an estimated 1,500 lion, 17,000
                    elephant, 48,000 buffalo and 1,000 leopards. It should certainly not be a pre-requisite of a safari
                    to see these or even a priority, as there are plenty of other fascinating animals and birds in the
                    African bush.

                    Parque Nacional do Limpopo is truly the perfect setting for an adventure without boundaries.
                    Together, Moçambique’s Parque Nacional do Limpopo, South Africa’s Kruger National Park and
                    Zimbabwe’s Gonarezhou National Park form the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park, covering a total of
                    3.3 million hectares - one of the largest wilderness conservation areas in the world.
