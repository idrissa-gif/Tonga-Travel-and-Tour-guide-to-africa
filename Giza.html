      <h3>Visit The Great Pyramids of Giza</h3>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </section>



  <p class="intro">The Great Pyramid of Giza (also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or the Pyramid of Cheops) is the oldest
    and largest of the three pyramids in the Giza pyramid complex bordering present-day Giza in Greater Cairo, Egypt. It
    is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact.

    Based on a mark in an interior chamber naming the work gang and a reference to the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh
    Khufu, Egyptologists believe that the pyramid was built as a tomb over a 10- to 20-year period concluding around
    2560 BC. Initially standing at 146.5 metres (481 feet), the Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the
    world for more than 3,800 years until Lincoln Cathedral was finished in 1311 AD. It is estimated that the pyramid
    weighs approximately 6 million tonnes, and consists of 2.3 million blocks of limestone and granite, some weighing as
    much as 80 tonnes. Originally, the Great Pyramid was covered by limestone casing stones that formed a smooth outer
    surface; what is seen today is the underlying core structure. Some of the casing stones that once covered the
    structure can still be seen around the base. There have been varying scientific and alternative theories about the
    Great Pyramid's construction techniques. Most accepted construction hypotheses are based on the idea that it was
    built by moving huge stones from a quarry and dragging and lifting them into place.

      <h5>Overview</h5>

      <p class="description">
        Giza is a Governorate to the west of the Egyptian capital Cairo - a city in its own right, but for a long time
        now absorbed as part of the heavily-populated and sprawling Cairo metropolis. Giza is best known as that part of
        Cairo closest to the world-famous Pyramids of Giza, situated high on the desert plateau immediately to the west
        of the urban district, itself located in the valley and centred around the Pyramids Road, linking central Cairo
        with the ancient wonders. One of the premier attractions of Egypt, if not the world, the Pyramids of Giza
        represent the archetypal pyramid structures of ancient Egyptian civilisation and - together with the Sphinx at
        the base of the Giza plateau - are the iconic image of Egypt.


      </p>

      <h5>History of The Great Pyramids of Giza </h5>
      <p class="description">
        The three main Pyramids of Giza are the focal point of the Giza necropolis, or cemetery, that served the elite
        of the Old Kingdom capital of Egypt at nearby Memphis during the mid to late 4th Dynasty (late 3rd millennium
        BCE). Three pharaohs were buried here in turn - Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure - their astounding burials attracted
        a number of surrounding, associated, burials of their queens, family members and nobility.
        <br>
        <br>
        Egyptologists believe the pyramid was built as a tomb for the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu (often
        Hellenized as "Cheops") and was constructed over a 20-year period. Khufu's vizier, Hemiunu (also called Hemon),
        is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid. It is thought that, at construction, the Great
        Pyramid was originally 146.6 metres (481.0 ft) tall, but with the removal of its original casing, its present
        height is 137 metres (449.5 ft). The lengths of the sides at the base are difficult to reconstruct, given the
        absence of the casing, but recent analyses put them in a range between 230.26 metres (755.4 ft) and 230.44
        metres (756.0 ft). The volume, including an internal hillock, is roughly 2,300,000 cubic metres (81,000,000 cu
        ft).
        <br>
        <br>
        The first precision measurements of the pyramid were made by Egyptologist Sir Flinders Petrie in 1880–82 and
        published as The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh. Almost all reports are based on his measurements. Many of the
        casing-stones and inner chamber blocks of the Great Pyramid fit together with extremely high precision. Based on
        measurements taken on the north-eastern casing stones, the mean opening of the joints is only 0.5 millimetres
        (0.020 in) wide. The pyramid remained the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years,
        unsurpassed until the 160-metre-tall (520 ft) spire of Lincoln Cathedral was completed c. 1300.

      <h5>How to get there</h5>
      <p class="description">
      <ol>
        <li>By Taxi: The Pyramids may be nearer than you think, so it's possible to take a taxi to the Pyramids from any
          part of Cairo at a reasonable cost, and it's certainly the fastest and easiest method. There are several
          options for this: private car or unmetered & metered taxis. You can also take Uber to the Pyramids. Use the
          Careem application (Middle East version of Uber) for Android or iPhones to order a car and professional
          driver. With real-time GPS tracking and credit card payment options for fixed rates, it is the cleanest,
          safest, haggle-free way to get around in Cairo. This option is especially recommended for women solo
          travellers
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>By Public Transport: CTA bus From central Cairo, the optimum way to get to the Giza Pyramids using public
          mass transit options is by bus routes 355 or 357 - a large white, air-conditioned coach with CTA (Cairo
          Transport Authority) on the side. Travelling every 20 minutes from the airport and Heliopolis, the bus stops
          (or doesn't - you may have to flag it down!) at the Abdel Menem Riyad Station in Midan Tahrir, next to the
          Egyptian Museum, before continuing out to Giza and the Pyramids.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>By Subway/Metro: Metro Line 2 now runs from Cairo to Giza, although it doesn't go all the way to the
          Pyramids. Get off at "Giza" station (not "El Giza"). Outside the metro station, a shared taxi can be hired:
          look for old Volkswagen cars. A taxi to the pyramids will be less expensive if you take the white metered
          taxis.
        </li>
        <br>
      </ol>
      </p>
    </div>





    <div id="about">

      <h5>Attractions in Giza</h5>
      <p class="description">
      <ol>
        <li>Great Pyramid of Giza/Khufu (Cheops) - the last surviving representative of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient
          World, originally 146 m (479 ft) high but now slightly reduced to a still awe-inspiring 137 m (449 ft). Over
          2 million blocks of stone were used to construct this edifice, all through organized manual labour.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Solar Barque Museum - located immediately alongside the southern face of the Great Pyramid, an exceptionally
          well-done museum showcasing an excavated and reconstructed "solar boat", buried along with the Pharaoh for
          use on his daily journey with the sun across the sky.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Pyramid of Khafre (Chephren) - slightly smaller than the Great Pyramid, though appearing from some angles to
          appear larger owing to a better position on the desert plateau
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Pyramid of Menkaure (Mycerinus) - the smallest of the Giza Pyramids at 62 m (203 ft) high (originally 66.5m)
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Sphinx and the Temple of the Sphinx - the colossal, recumbent human-headed lion was conceived of by the
          ancient Egyptians as the sun god Re-Horakhty - "Horus of the horizon". The Egyptians call it Abu el-Hol, the
          "Father of Terror", and even the Greek name Sphinx is the less than pleasant "Strangler". 45 meters long, 22
          meters wide, and carved from a single giant block of sandstone, the Sphinx is considerably smaller than the
          Pyramids around it. The missing nose is blamed on target practice by bored troops, commonly blamed variously
          on British soldiers in World War I or Napoleon's troops in 1798, but 18th-century drawings showing the nose
          already missing, pointing the finger towards the occupying Turks. ( in fact the damage is recorded as having
          occurred in about 1134 , as an iconoclastc act of a local religious leader )
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Various Queens' Pyramids and Nobles' Tombs, located in regimented cemeteries surrounding the royal pyramids.
          Especially the Tomb of Seshemnufer IV which you can explore from the inside, where you can descend to the
          sarcophagus and get an idea, how it looks. Since this is not the main object, there are few tourists and it
          make this visit very interesting.
        </li>
        <br>
      </ol>

      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h5>Things to do in Abu Simbel</h5>
      <p class="description">
      <ul>
        <li>Go on a classic camel ride. A camel ride around the Pyramids is pretty cliche, and many have found the
          experience was not at all what they expected, but many are also thrilled by it.
        </li> <br>

        <li>Go horse riding in the desert to experience both the spirit of the Egyptian horses and the true majesty of
          the Pyramids from outside the 'circus ring' wall. Be careful of touts, however; it's best to ride from a
          reputable stable. Ride in the shadow of the Great Pyramids or even further afield on a half day trip to
          <a href="#">Saqqara</a> or Abu Sir.
        </li> <br>

        <li>See the sunrise, the first sun beams colouring the Pyramids from the terrace on the third floor of a cafe or
          from the roof terrace of the hostel situated near the second western entrance and ticket-office.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Where to Stay in Giza</h5>
      <p class="description">
      <p>General accommodation options are somewhat limited within the Giza district - most travellers tend to stay in

        option if you want a more laid back vibe and your fine with doing day-trips in to Cairo to see the sights. For
        people determined to stay in close vicinity and / or for whom cost is no issue, although cheaper options are
