    <p class="intro">Murchison Falls National Park is Uganda's biggest park pride of a complete tour experience, from
        falls, Wildlife game drive, breathtaking sceneries, world-class lodges, thrilling cultural experience, birding,
        air-balloon experience.


        The park is bisected by the Victoria Nile, which plunges 45m over the remnant rift valley wall, creating the
        dramatic Murchison Falls, the centerpiece of the park and the final event in an 80km stretch of rapids. The
        mighty cascade drains the last of the river's energy, transforming it into a broad, placid stream that flows
        quietly across the rift valley floor into Lake Albert. This stretch of river provides one of Uganda's most
        remarkable wildlife spectacles. Regular visitors to the riverbanks include elephants, giraffes and buffaloes;
        while hippos, Nile crocodiles and aquatic birds are permanent residents

            <h5>Overview</h5>

            <p class="description">
                Murchison Falls National Park is Uganda's largest national park. It measures approximately 3,893 square
                kilometres (1,503 sq mi). The park is bisected by the Victoria Nile from east to west for a distance of
                about 115 kilometres (71 mi). The park is the location of the Murchison Falls, where the waters of the
                Nile flow through a narrow gorge only 7 metres (23 ft) wide before plunging 43 metres (141 ft). Also in
                the park, adjacent to the Masindi-Gulu Highway, are the Karuma Falls, the location of the 600 megawatt
                Karuma Power Station, which will be Uganda's largest power station when it comes online circa 2018.
                <br>
                <br>
                Murchison Falls National Park lies at the northern end of the Albertine Rift Valley, where the sweeping
                Bunyoro escarpment tumbles into vast, palm-dotted Savannah. First gazetted as a game reserve in 1926, it
                is Uganda's largest and oldest conservation area, hosting 76 species of mammals and 451 birds.
                <br>
                <br>
                Murchison Falls national park straddles the Ugandan districts of Buliisa, Nwoya, Kiryandongo, and
                Masindi. The driving distance from Masindi, the nearest large town, to the Kibanda area of the national
                park is about 72 kilometres (45 mi). This area is about 283 kilometres (176 mi), by road, north-west of
                Kampala, the capital and largest city of Uganda. The coordinates of the park near the Kibanda area are
                02°11'15.0"N, 31°46'53.0"E (Latitude:2.187499; Longitude:31.781400).

            <h5>History of Murchison Falls National Park </h5>
            <p class="description">
                The explorers John Speke and James Grant were the first Europeans to visit the present day Murchison
                Falls National Park in 1862. It was more thoroughly explored by Samuel and Florence Baker in 1863-4.
                Baker named the falls Murchison Falls after the geologist Roderick Murchison, then the president of the
                Royal Geographical Society.
                <br>
                <br>
                Between 1907 and 1912, the inhabitants of an area of about 13,000 square kilometres (5,000 sq mi) were
                evacuated due to sleeping sickness spread by tse-tse flies. In 1910, the Bunyoro Game Reserve was
                created south of the River Nile. That area roughly corresponds to the part of the Murchison Falls
                National Park that is in the districts of Buliisa, Masindi, and Kiryandongo. In 1928, the boundaries
                were extended north of the river into the modern-day Nwoya District. In 1952, the British administration
                established the National Parks Act of Uganda. The area described above became Murchison Falls National
                Park.

                <h5>Murchison Falls</h5>
                <p class="description">
                    Murchison Falls is characterized by eternal war between rock and water. The waters violently
                    compress through a narrow gorge, spraying misty droplets along their wake over a 50m radius. This
                    creates a permanent rainbow over the battlefield and causes a continuous roar. From Baker Point on
                    the southern side, you can also view the Nile splitting into the smaller Uhuru Falls, created in
                    1962 when the river burst its banks.

                <h5>River Nile</h5>
                <p class="description">
                    A boat ride along the Nile to the foot of Murchison Falls is a rewarding experience for nature
                    lovers, as the northern bank teems with a variety of mammals, birds and reptiles. Guided nature
                    walks along both the north and south banks are another refreshing activity, and sport fishing is
                    also possible here. Rafting will be available starting in 2012.

                <h5>Buligi Game Tracks</h5>
                <p class="description">
                    The Buligi game tracks, stretching between the Victoria and Albert Niles, are the Murchison Falls
                    National Park’s most popular safari destination. At around 120-170km in length, they pass through
                    open Savannah grassland, woodland, acacia and riverine vegetation. Most of the park’s game can be
                    viewed here, especially during early morning and early evening tours.

                </p>

                <p class="description">
                <h5>Karuma Falls</h5>
                <p class="description">
                    The Karuma Falls are located in Chobe, in the northeastern sector of the park. These roaring
                    waterfalls on the Victoria Nile are made up of a series of natural rock formations which cause the
                    waters to ripple and give them a white, foamy appearance. It is an ideal area for sport fishing.

                </p>

                <p class="description">
                <h5>Rabongo Forests</h5>
                <p class="description">
                    Surrounded by Savannah and covering just 4km2, Rabongo Forest is considered a birders’ paradise
                    because of the endangered species found here. Rabongo is ideal for educational tours as it provides
                    opportunities to identify animals, birds, medicinal plants and trees. For relaxation, visitors can
                    camp and enjoy picnics by the Wairingo River.
                </p>

                <p class="description">
                <h5>Paraa</h5>
                <p class="description">
                    "Paraa", meaning home of the hippo in the local Luo language, is the park’s tourism hub. All the
                    park’s access roads converge here as the northern and southern banks are linked by a passenger
                    ferry, and several accommodations are located nearby. Additionally, a museum and gift shop can be
                    found on the north bank, and most game drives, launch trips and nature walks commence here.
                </p>

                <h5>Kaniyo Pabidi Forest</h5>
                <p class="description">
                    In the south of Murchison Falls Conservation Area, this forest ecosystem contains black-and-white
                    colobus and blue monkeys, olive baboons, and a habituated chimp group which can be tracked.
                    Elephants, buffalos, lions and leopards are also frequent visitors. Many forest birds can be viewed
                    here, including the chocolate-backed kingfisher, white-thighed hornbill and Puvel's illadopsis which
                    is found nowhere else in East Africa.

                <h5>Big Game</h5>
                <p class="description">
                    The park is home to 76 species of mammals including four of the “Big Five”, with huge herds of
                    buffaloes and elephants, well-camouflaged leopards and a healthy population of lions. It is also
                    known for its giraffes; in Uganda these can only be viewed here and in Kidepo Valley. Other species
                    viewed regularly along the game tracks include Jackson’s hartebeest, bushbucks, Uganda kob,
                    waterbucks and warthogs. Resident crocodiles and hippos as well as other, visiting wildlife are
                    found along the river.

                <h5>Primates</h5>
                <p class="description">
                    Olive baboons are common along the roadsides – be sure to keep car windows and doors shut if you
                    don’t want to lose your lunch! Blue and red-tailed monkeys and black-and-white colobus can be found
                    in the forested sectors. The Savannah-dwelling patas monkey is only found here and in Kidepo Valley
                    National Park. Around 800 chimpanzees live in the Kaniyo Pabidi and Budongo Forests.

                    The varied habitats of Uganda’s largest park make it home to a variety of birds with 451 species
                    recorded. The list includes the Shoebill Stork, the Goliath Heron – the largest heron in the world –
                    and pairs of elegant Grey Crowned Cranes - Uganda’s national bird. Also seen along the banks of the
                    Nile are the Blue-headed Coucal, Swamp Flycatcher, Squacco Heron, African Jacana, Sandpipers,

                <p class="description">
                <p>General accommodation options are somewhat limited within the Giza district - most travellers tend to

                    option if you want a more laid back vibe and your fine with doing day-trips in to Cairo to see the
                    sights. For
                    people determined to stay in close vicinity and / or for whom cost is no issue, although cheaper
                    options are
                    springing up, there are a number of very comfortable options:
